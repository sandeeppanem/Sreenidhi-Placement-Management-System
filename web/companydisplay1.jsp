<p>Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT, HKEX: 4338) is a multinational computer technology corporation that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of
software products for computing devices.[9]  Headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA, its most profitable products are the Microsoft Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office suite of productivity software.
</p>

<p>The company was founded on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800.
Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s,
followed by the Windows line of operating systems. Many of its products have achieved near-ubiquity in the
desktop computer market. One commentator notes that Microsoft's original mission was "a computer on every desk and in every home,
running Microsoft software."[10] Microsoft possesses footholds in other markets, with assets such as the MSNBC cable television network
and the MSN Internet portal. The company also markets both computer hardware products such as the Microsoft mouse and the Microsoft Natural
keyboard, as well as home entertainment products such as the Xbox, Xbox 360, Zune and MSN TV.[9] The company's initial public stock offering
(IPO) was in 1986; the ensuing rise of the company's stock price has made four billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.
